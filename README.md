# udacity_PortfolioProject
A blog or portfolio starter template. This is for the "Build a Portfolio Site" Project in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## Template features

- Responsive layout
- Images has descriptive text using `alt` attribute

## Template limitations
because this template is just a starter code it has limitations like:
- 1 page only
- Fixed to 3 projects only
- Doesn't have a backend implemented
- Everything is hard coded

So fell free to fork this template and add any additional features you want. Pull requests would be appreciated.
